A web-based company wants to improve its conversion rate on its landing page Using a large historical dataset of customer visits, the company has repeatedly
trained a multi-class deep learning network algorithm on Amazon SageMaker However there is an overfitting problem training data shows 90% accuracy in
predictions, while test data shows 70% accuracy only
The company needs to boost the generalization of its model before deploying it into production to maximize conversions of visits to purchases
Which action is recommended to provide the HIGHEST accuracy model for the company's test and validation data?
A. Increase the randomization of training data in the mini-batches used in training.
B. Allocate a higher proportion of the overall data to the training dataset
C. Apply L1 or L2 regularization and dropouts to the training.
D. Reduce the number of layers and units (or neurons) from the deep learning network.
Answer: C
Explanation:
If this is a ComputerVision problem augmentation can help and we may consider A an option. However in analyzing customer historic data, there is no easy way to
increase randomization in training. If you go deep into modelling and coding. When you build model with tensorflow/pytorch, most of the time the trainloader is
already sampling in data in random manner (with shuffle enable). What we usually do to reduce overfitting is by adding dropout.

C. Train an Amazon SageMaker k-means clustering algorithm to forecast demand for the new product.
D. Train a custom XGBoost model to forecast demand for the new product
Answer: B
Explanation:
The Amazon SageMaker DeepAR forecasting algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm for forecasting scalar (one-dimensional) time series using recurrent
neural networks (RNN). Classical forecasting methods, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) or exponential smoothing (ETS), fit a single
model to each individual time series. They then use that model to extrapolate the time series into the future.
