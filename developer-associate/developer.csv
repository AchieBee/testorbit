An application running on Amazon EC2 instances must access objects within an Amaon S3 busket that are encrypted using server-side encryption using AWS
KMS encryption keys (SSE-KMS). The application must have access to the customer master key (CMK) to decrypt the objects.
Which combination of steps will grant the application access? (Select TWO.)
A. Write an S3 bucket policy that grants the bucket access to the key.
B. Grant access to the key in the IAM EC2 role attached to the application’s EC2 instances.
C. Write a key policy that enables IAM policies to grant access to the key.
D. Grant access to the key in the S3 bucket’s ACL
E. Create a Systems Manager parameter that exposes the KMS key to the EC2 instances.
Answer: BC
Explanation:
https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/decrypt-kms-encrypted-objects-s3/ IAM role needs access to the keys to decrypt the object and key
policies must allow role access to the key. Key policies are the primary way to control access to customer master keys (CMKs) in AWS KMS. You need the
permission to decrypt the AWS KMS key. When a user sends a GET request, Amazon S3 checks if the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role
that sent the request is authorized to decrypt the key associated with the object. If the IAM user or role belongs to the same AWS account as the key, then the
permission to decrypt must be granted on the AWS KMS key’s policy.

Explanation:
AWS documentation - Cognito MFA Managing Security
You can add multi-factor authentication (MFA) to a user pool to protect the identity of your users. MFA adds a second authentication method that doesn't rely solely
on user name and password. You can choose to use SMS text messages, or time-based one-time (TOTP) passwords as second factors in signing in your users.
You can also use adaptive authentication with its risk-based model to predict when you might need another authentication factor. It's part of the user pool

https://aws.amazon.com/sns/faqs/
Q: What are the different delivery formats/transports for receiving notifications?
In order for customers to have broad flexibility of delivery mechanisms, Amazon SNS supports notifications over multiple transport protocols. Customers can select
one the following transports as part of the subscription requests:
“HTTP”, “HTTPS” – Subscribers specify a URL as part of the subscription registration; notifications will be delivered through an HTTP POST to the specified URL.
”Email”, “Email-JSON” – Messages are sent to registered addresses as email. Email-JSON sends notifications as a JSON object, while Email sends text-based
email.
“SQS” – Users can specify an SQS standard queue as the endpoint; Amazon SNS will enqueue a notification message to the specified queue (which subscribers
can then process using SQS APIs such as ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage, etc.). Note that FIFO queues are not currently supported.
“SMS” – Messages are sent to registered phone numbers as SMS text messages.

Company C has recently launched an online commerce site for bicycles on AWS. They have a "Product" DynamoDB table that stores details for each bicycle, such
as, manufacturer, color, price, quantity and size to display in the online store. Due to customer demand, they want to include an image for each bicycle along with
the existing details.
Which approach below provides the least impact to provisioned throughput on the "Product" table?
A. Serialize the image and store it in multiple DynamoDB tables
B. Create an "Images" DynamoDB table to store the Image with a foreign key constraint to the "Product” table
C. Add an image data type to the "Product" table to store the images in binary format
D. Store the images in Amazon S3 and add an S3 URL pointer to the "Product" table item for each image
Answer: D
Explanation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-use-s3-too.html#bp-use-s3-too-large-v For example, consider the ProductCatalog table
in the Creating Tables and Loading Data for Code Examples in DynamoDB section. Items in this table store information about item price, description, book
authors, and dimensions for other products. If you wanted to store an image of each product that was too large to fit in an item, you could store the images in
Amazon S3 instead of in DynamoDB.

CloudWatch definitely. Random key prefixes is still a valid method of improving performance by using parallel reads. It doesn't mention prefix hashing. For instance
prefixes 1/,2/,3/,4,5/ could provide 5 x parallel streams for S3 as opposed to all objects being in a single folder/prefix e.g. dev/
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/optimizing-performance.html
"There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. You can increase your read or write performance by parallelizing reads. For example, if you create 10
prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read performance to 55,000 read requests per second." The assumption that prefixes
don't matter is incorrect, as described by "Amazon S3 performance guidelines recommended randomizing prefix naming with **hashed characters** to optimize
performance for frequent data retrievals. You no longer have to randomize prefix naming for performance, and can use sequential date-based naming for your
prefixes"

NEW QUESTION 386
- (Exam Topic 2)
A Developer is investigating an issue whereby certain requests are passing through an Amazon API Gateway endpoint /MyAPI, but the requests do not reach the
AWS Lambda function backing /MyAPI. The Developer found that a second Lambda function sometimes runs at maximum concurrency allowed for the given AWS
account.

NEW QUESTION 419
- (Exam Topic 2)
A company experienced partial downtime during the last deployment of a new application AWS Elastic Beanstalk split the environment's Amazon EC2 instances
into batches and deployed a new version one batch at a time after taking them out of service. Therefore, full capacity was not maintained during deployment.
The developer plans to release a new version of the application, and is looking for a policy that will maintain full capacity and minimize the impact of the failed
deployment
Which deployment policy should the developer use?
A. Immutable
B. All at Once
C. Rolling
D. Rolling with an Additional Batch
Answer: A
Explanation:
Immutable infrastructure has become a new norm in IT operations. Immutable Deployment is one of those approaches, and it simply means: Immutable: the
“staging” environment, once ready to become production, doesn't change. If we need to change something, we then deploy new code on completely new
infrastructure. The benefits of an immutable infrastructure include more consistency and reliability in your infrastructure and a simpler, more predictable
deployment process

NEW QUESTION 427
- (Exam Topic 2)
A Developer is storing sensitive documents in Amazon S3 that will require encryption at rest. The encryption keys must be rotated annually, at least.
What is the easiest way to achieve this?
A. Encrypt the data before sending it to Amazon S3
B. Import a custom key into AWS KMS with annual rotation enabled
C. Use AWS KMS with automatic key rotation
D. Export a key from AWS KMS to encrypt the data
Answer: C
Explanation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-storeoverview.html
You can use the same techniques to view and manage the CMKs in your custom key store that you use for CMKs in the AWS KMS key store. You can control
access with IAM and key policies, create tags and aliases, enable and disable the CMKs, and schedule key deletion. You can use the CMKs for cryptographic
operations and use them with AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS. However, you cannot enable automatic key rotation and you cannot import key material
into a CMK in a custom key store.
Q: Can I rotate my keys? Yes. You can choose to have AWS KMS automatically rotate CMKs every year, provided that those keys were generated within AWS
KMS HSMs. Automatic key rotation is not supported for imported keys, asymmetric keys, or keys generated in an AWS CloudHSM cluster using the AWS KMS
custom key store feature. If you choose to import keys to AWS KMS or asymmetric keys or use a custom key store, you can manually rotate them by creating a
new CMK and mapping an existing key alias from the old CMK to the new CMK. https://aws.amazon.com/kms/faqs/
