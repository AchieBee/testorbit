The benefits of an immutable infrastructure include more consistency and reliability in your infrastructure and a simpler  more predictable deployment process
- (Exam Topic 2) A Developer is publishing critical log data to a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Lops  which was created 2 months ago.

Use AWS KMS with automatic key rotation,D. Export a key from AWS KMS to encrypt the data,,,3,radio,,,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-storeoverview.html You can use the same techniques to view and manage the CMKs in your custom key store that you use for CMKs in the AWS KMS key store. You can control access with IAM and key policies  create tags and aliases  enable and disable the CMKs  and schedule key deletion. You can use the CMKs for cryptographic operations and use them with AWS services that integrate with AWS KMS. However  you cannot enable automatic key rotation and you cannot import key material into a CMK in a custom key store. Q: Can I rotate my keys? Yes. You can choose to have AWS KMS automatically rotate CMKs every year  provided that those keys were generated within AWS KMS HSMs. Automatic key rotation is not supported for imported keys  asymmetric keys  or keys generated in an AWS CloudHSM cluster using the AWS KMS custom key store feature. If you choose to import keys to AWS KMS or asymmetric keys or use a custom key store  you can manually rotate them by creating a new CMK and mapping an existing key alias from the old CMK to the new CMK. https://aws.amazon.com/kms/faqs/
