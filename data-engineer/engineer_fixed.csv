A data engineer needs to join data from multiple sources to perform a one-time analysis job. The data is stored in Amazon DynamoDB  Amazon RDS  Amazon Redshift  and Amazon S3. Which solution will meet this requirement MOST cost-effectively?,A. Use an Amazon EMR provisioned cluster to read from all source,B. Use Apache Spark to join the data and perform the analysis.,C. Copy the data from DynamoDB  Amazon RDS  and Amazon Redshift into Amazon S3. Run Amazon Athena queries directly on the S3 files.,D. Use Amazon Athena Federated Query to join the data from all data sources.,E. Use Redshift Spectrum to query data from DynamoDB  Amazon RDS  and Amazon S3 directly from Redshift.,,3,radio,,,Amazon Athena Federated Query is a feature that allows you to query data from multiple sources using standard SQL. You can use Athena Federated Query to join data from Amazon DynamoDB  Amazon RDS  Amazon Redshift  and Amazon S3  as well as other data sources such as MongoDB  Apache HBase  and Apache Kafka1. Athena Federated Query is a serverless and interactive service  meaning you do not need to provision or manage any infrastructure  and you only pay for the amount of data scanned by your queries. Athena Federated Query is the most cost-effective solution for performing a one-time analysis job on data from multiple sources  as it eliminates the need to copy or move data  and allows you to query data directly from the source. The other options are not as cost-effective as Athena Federated Query  as they involve additional steps or costs. Option A requires you to provision and pay for an Amazon EMR cluster  which can be expensive and time-consuming for a one-time job. Option B requires you to copy or move data from DynamoDB  RDS  and Redshift to S3  which can incur additional costs for data transfer and storage  and also introduce latency and complexity. Option D requires you to have an existing Redshift cluster  which can be costly and may not be necessary for a one-time job. Option D also does not supportquerying data from RDS directly  so you would need to use Redshift Federated Query to access RDS data  which adds another layer of complexity2. References: ?

A company uses an Amazon QuickSight dashboard to monitor usage of one of the company's applications. The company uses AWS Glue jobs to process data for the dashboard. The company stores the data in a single Amazon S3 bucket. The company adds new data every day. A data engineer discovers that dashboard queries are becoming slower over time. The data engineer determines that the root cause of the slowing queries is longrunning AWS Glue jobs. Which actions should the data engineer take to improve the performance of the AWS Glue jobs? (Choose two.),A. Partition the data that is in the S3 bucke,B. Organize the data by year  month  and day.,C. Increase the AWS Glue instance size by scaling up the worker type.,D. Convert the AWS Glue schema to the DynamicFrame schema class.,E. Adjust AWS Glue job scheduling frequency so the jobs run half as many times each day.,F. Modify the 1AM role that grants access to AWS glue to grant access to all S3 features.,1,radio,,,Partitioning the data in the S3 bucket can improve the performance of AWS Glue jobs by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned and processed. By organizingthe data by year  month  and day  the AWS Glue job can use partition pruning to filter out irrelevant data and only read the data that matches the query criteria. This can speed up the data processing and reduce the cost of running the AWS Glue job. Increasing the AWS Glue instance size by scaling up the worker type can also improve the performance of AWS Glue jobs by providing more memory and CPU resources for the Spark execution engine. This can help the AWS Glue job handle larger data sets and complex transformations more efficiently. The other options are either incorrect or irrelevant  as they do not affect the performance of the AWS Glue jobs. Converting the AWS Glue schema to the DynamicFrame schema class does not improve the performance  but rather provides additional functionality and flexibility for data manipulation. Adjusting the AWS Glue job scheduling frequency does not improve the performance  but rather reduces the frequency of data updates. Modifying the IAM role that grants access to AWS Glue does not improve the performance  but rather affects the security and permissions of the AWS Glue service. References: ?

A data engineer maintains custom Python scripts that perform a data formatting process that many AWS Lambda functions use. When the data engineer needs to modify the Python scripts  the data engineer must manually update all the Lambda functions. The data engineer requires a less manual way to update the Lambda functions. Which solution will meet this requirement?,A. Store a pointer to the custom Python scripts in the execution context object in a shared Amazon S3 bucket.,B. Package the custom Python scripts into Lambda layer,C. Apply the Lambda layers to the Lambda functions.,D. Store a pointer to the custom Python scripts in environment variables in a shared Amazon S3 bucket.,E. Assign the same alias to each Lambda functio,F. Call reach Lambda function by specifying the function's alias.,2,radio,,,Lambda layers are a way to share code and dependencies across multiple Lambda functions. By packaging the custom Python scripts into Lambda layers  the data engineer can update the scripts in one place and have them automatically applied to all the Lambda functions that use the layer. This reduces the manual effort and ensures consistency across the Lambda functions. The other options are either not feasible or not efficient. Storing a pointer to the custom Python scripts in the execution context object or in environment variables would require the Lambda functions to download the scripts from Amazon S3 every time they are invoked  which would increase latency and cost. Assigning the same alias to each Lambda function would not help with updating the Python scripts  as the alias only points to a specific version of the Lambda function code. References: ? AWS Lambda layers ? AWS Certified Data Engineer - Associate DEA-C01 Complete Study Guide  Chapter 3: Data Ingestion and Transformation  Section 3.4: AWS Lambda
A data engineer is configuring Amazon SageMaker Studio to use AWS Glue interactive sessions to prepare data for machine learning (ML) models. The data engineer receives an access denied error when the data engineer tries to prepare the data by using SageMaker Studio. Which change should the engineer make to gain access to SageMaker Studio?,A. Add the AWSGlueServiceRole managed policy to the data engineer's IAM user.,B. Add a policy to the data engineer's IAM user that includes the sts:AssumeRole action for the AWS Glue and SageMaker service principals in the trust policy.,C. Add the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess managed policy to the data engineer's IAM user.,D. Add a policy to the data engineer's IAM user that allows the sts:AddAssociation action for the AWS Glue and SageMaker service principals in the trust policy.,,,2,radio,,,This solution meets the requirement of gaining access to SageMaker Studio to use AWS Glue interactive sessions. AWS Glue interactive sessions are a way to use AWS Glue DataBrew and AWS Glue Data Catalog from within SageMaker Studio. To use AWS Glue interactive sessions  the data engineer’s IAM user needs to have permissions to assume the AWS Glue service role and the SageMaker execution role. By adding a policy to the data engineer’s IAM user that includes the sts:AssumeRole action for the AWS Glue and SageMaker service principals in the trust policy  the data engineer can grant these permissions and avoid the access denied error. The other options are not sufficient or necessary to resolve the error. References: ? Get started with data integration from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift using AWS Glue interactive sessions ?

A data engineer needs to schedule a workflow that runs a set of AWS Glue jobs every day. The data engineer does not require the Glue jobs to run or finish at a specific time. Which solution will run the Glue jobs in the MOST cost-effective way?,A. Choose the FLEX execution class in the Glue job properties.,B. Use the Spot Instance type in Glue job properties.,C. Choose the STANDARD execution class in the Glue job properties.,D. Choose the latest version in the GlueVersion field in the Glue job properties.,,,1,radio,,,The FLEX execution class allows you to run AWS Glue jobs on spare compute capacity instead of dedicated hardware. This can reduce the cost of running nonurgent or non-time sensitive data integration workloads  such as testing and one-time data loads. The FLEX execution class is available for AWS Glue 3.0 Spark jobs. The other options are not as cost-effective as FLEX  because they either use dedicated resources (STANDARD) or do not affect the cost at all (Spot Instance type and GlueVersion). References: ?

The data engineer wants to perform real-time analytics on the incoming streaming data by using time-based aggregations over a window of up to 30 minutes. The data engineer needs a solution that is highly fault tolerant. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?,A. Use an AWS Lambda function that includes both the business and the analytics logic to perform time-based aggregations over a window of up to 30 minutes for the data in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.,B. Use Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink (previously known as Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics) to analyze the data that might occasionally contain duplicates by using multiple types of aggregations.,C. Use an AWS Lambda function that includes both the business and the analytics logic to perform aggregations for a tumbling window of up to 30 minutes  based on the event timestamp.,D.

A company is planning to upgrade its Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) General Purpose SSD storage from gp2 to gp3. The company wants to prevent any interruptions in its Amazon EC2 instances that will cause data loss during the migration to the upgraded storage. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?,A. Create snapshots of the gp2 volume,B. Create new gp3 volumes from the snapshot,C. Attach the new gp3 volumes to the EC2 instances.,D. Create new gp3 volume,E. Gradually transfer the data to the new gp3 volume,F. When the transfer is complete  mount the new gp3 volumes to the EC2 instances to replace the gp2 volumes. G. Change the volume type of the existing gp2 volumes to gp3. Enter new values for volume size  IOPS  and throughput. H. Use AWS DataSync to create new gp3 volume I. Transfer the data from the original gp2 volumes to the new gp3 volumes.,3,radio,,,Changing the volume type of the existing gp2 volumes to gp3 is the easiest and fastest way to migrate to the new storage type without any downtime or data loss. You can use the AWS Management Console  the AWS CLI  or the Amazon EC2 API to modify the volume type  size  IOPS  and throughput of your gp2 volumes. The modification takes effect immediately  and you can monitor the progress of the modification using CloudWatch. The other options are either more complex or require additional steps  such as creating snapshots  transferring data  or attaching new volumes  which can increase the operational overhead and the risk of errors.

A data engineer is building a data pipeline on AWS by using AWS Glue extract  transform  and load (ETL) jobs. The data engineer needs to process data from Amazon RDS and MongoDB  perform transformations  and load the transformed data into Amazon Redshift for analytics. The data updates must occur every hour. Which combination of tasks will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead? (Choose two.),A. Configure AWS Glue triggers to run the ETL jobs even/ hour.,B. Use AWS Glue DataBrewto clean and prepare the data for analytics.,C. Use AWS Lambda functions to schedule and run the ETL jobs even/ hour.,D. Use AWS Glue connections to establish connectivity between the data sources and Amazon Redshift.,E. Use the Redshift Data API to load transformed data into Amazon Redshift.,,1,radio,,,The correct answer is to configure AWS Glue triggers to run the ETL jobs every hour and use AWS Glue connections to establish connectivity between the data sources and Amazon Redshift. AWS Glue triggers are a way to schedule and orchestrate ETL jobs with the least operational overhead. AWS Glue connections are a way to securely connect to data sources and targets using JDBC or MongoDB drivers. AWS Glue DataBrew is a visual data preparation tool that does not support MongoDB as a data source. AWS Lambda functions are a serverless option to schedule and run ETL jobs  but they have a limit of 15 minutes for execution time  which may not be enough for complex transformations. The Redshift Data API is a way to run SQL commands on Amazon Redshift clusters without needing a persistent connection  but it does not support loading data from AWS Glue ETL jobs. References: ?

A company needs to set up a data catalog and metadata management for data sources that run in the AWS Cloud. The company will use the data catalog to maintain the metadata of all the objects that are in a set of data stores. The data stores include structured sources such as Amazon RDS and Amazon Redshift. The data stores also include semistructured sources such as JSON files and .xml files that are stored in Amazon S3. The company needs a solution that will update the data catalog on a regular basis. The solution also must detect changes to the source metadata. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?,Use Amazon Aurora as the data catalog.,Create AWS Lambda functions that will connect to the data catalog.,Configure the Lambda functions to gather the metadata information from multiple sources and to update the Aurora data catalog.,Schedule the Lambda functions to run periodically.,Use the AWS Glue Data Catalog as the central metadata repository.,Use AWS Glue crawlers to connect to multiple data stores and to update the Data Catalog with metadata change.,2,radio,,,
A company uses Amazon Athena to run SQL queries for extract  transform  and load (ETL) tasks by using Create Table As Select (CTAS). The company must use Apache Spark instead of SQL to generate analytics. Which solution will give the company the ability to use Spark to access Athena?,A. Athena query settings,B. Athena workgroup,C. Athena data source,D. Athena query editor,,,3,radio,,,Athena data source is a solution that allows you to use Spark to access Athena by using the Athena JDBC driver and the Spark SQL interface. You can use the Athena data source to create Spark DataFrames from Athena tables  run SQL queries on the DataFrames  and write the results back to Athena. The Athena data source supports various data formats  such as CSV  JSON  ORC  and Parquet  and also supports partitioned and bucketed tables. The Athena data source is a cost-effective and scalable way to use Spark to access Athena  as it does not require any additional infrastructure or services  and you only pay for the data scanned by Athena. The other options are not solutions that give the company the ability to use Spark to access Athena. Option A  Athena query settings  is a feature that allows you to configure various parameters for your Athena queries  such as the output location  the encryption settings  the query timeout  and the workgroup. Option B  Athena workgroup  is a feature that allows you to isolate and manage your Athena queries and resources  such as the query history  the query notifications  the query concurrency  and the query cost. Option D  Athena query editor  is a feature that allows you to write and run SQL queries on Athena using the web console or the API. None of these options enable you to use Spark instead of SQL to generate analytics on Athena. References: ? Using Apache Spark in Amazon Athena ? Athena JDBC Driver ? Spark SQL ?

Create AWS Lambda user defined functions (UDFs) by using the Amazon Redshift Data AP L. Create an AWS Step Functions job to orchestrate the ingestion of the data that the analytics department will use into Amazon Redshift Serverless.,3,radio,,,The best solution to meet the requirements of creating a data catalog that includes the IoT data  and allowing the analytics department to index the data  most cost- effectively  is to create an Amazon Athena workgroup  explore the data that is in Amazon S3 by using Apache Spark through Athena  and provide the Athena workgroup schema and tables to the analytics department. Amazon Athena is a serverless  interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL or Python1. Amazon Athena also supports Apache Spark  an open-source distributed processing framework that can run large-scale data analytics applications across clusters of servers2. You can use Athena to run Spark code on data in Amazon S3 without having to set up  manage  or scale any infrastructure. You can also use Athena to create and manage external tables that point to your data in Amazon S3  and store them in an external data catalog  such as AWS Glue Data Catalog  Amazon Athena Data Catalog  or your own Apache Hive metastore3. You can create Athena workgroups to separate query execution and resource allocation based on different criteria  such as users  teams  or applications4. You can share the schemas and tables in your Athena workgroup with other users or applications  such as Amazon QuickSight  for data visualization and analysis5. Using Athena and Spark to create a data catalog and explore the IoT data in Amazon S3 is the most cost-effective solution  as you pay only for the queries you run or the compute you use  and you pay nothing when the service is idle1. You also save on the operational overhead and complexity of managing data warehouse infrastructure  as Athena and Spark are serverless and scalable. You can also benefit from the flexibility and performance of Athena and Spark  as they support various data formats  including JSON  and can handle schema changes and complex queries efficiently. Option A is not the best solution  as creating an AWS Glue Data Catalog  configuring an AWS Glue Schema Registry  creating a new AWS Glue workload to orchestrate theingestion of the data that the analytics department will use into Amazon Redshift Serverless  would incur more costs and complexity than using Athena and Spark. AWS Glue Data Catalog is a persistent metadata store that contains table definitions  job definitions  and other control information to help you manage your AWS Glue components6. AWS Glue Schema Registry is a service that allows you to centrally store and manage the schemas of your streaming data in AWS Glue Data Catalog7. AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy to prepare  clean  enrich  and move data between data stores8. Amazon Redshift Serverless is a feature of Amazon Redshift  a fully managed data warehouse service  that allows you to run and scale analytics without having to manage data warehouse infrastructure9. While these services are powerful and useful for many data engineering scenarios  they are not necessary or costeffective for creating a data catalog and indexing the IoT data in Amazon S3. AWS Glue Data Catalog and Schema Registry charge you based on the number of objects stored and the number of requests made67. AWS Glue charges you based on the compute time and the data processed by your ETL jobs8. Amazon Redshift Serverless charges you based on the amount of data scanned by your queries and the compute time used by your workloads9. These costs can add up quickly  especially if you have large volumes of IoT data and frequent schema changes. Moreover  using AWS Glue and Amazon Redshift Serverless would introduce additional latency and complexity  as you would have to ingest the data from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift Serverless  and then query it from there instead of querying it directly from Amazon S3 using Athena and Spark. Option B is not the best solution  as creating an Amazon Redshift provisioned cluster  creating an Amazon Redshift Spectrum database for the analytics department to explore the data that is in Amazon S3  and creating Redshift stored procedures to load the data into Amazon Redshift  would incur more costs and complexity than using Athena and Spark. Amazon Redshift provisioned clusters are clusters that you create and manage by specifying the number and type of nodes  and the amount of storage and compute capacity10. Amazon Redshift Spectrum is a feature of Amazon Redshift that allows you to query and join data across your data warehouse and your data lake using standard SQL11. Redshift stored procedures are SQL statements that you can define and store in Amazon Redshift  and then call them by using the CALL command12. While these features are powerful and useful for many data warehousing scenarios  they are not necessary or cost-effective for creating a data catalog and indexing the IoT data in Amazon S3. Amazon Redshift provisioned clusters charge you based on the node type  the number of nodes  and the duration of the cluster10. Amazon Redshift Spectrum charges you based on the amount of data scanned by your queries11. These costs can add up quickly  especially if you have large volumes of IoT data and frequent schema changes. Moreover  using Amazon Redshift provisioned clusters and Spectrum would introduce additional latency and complexity  as you would have to provision andmanage the cluster  create an external schema and database for the data in Amazon S3  and load the data into the cluster using stored procedures  instead of querying it directly from Amazon S3 using Athena and Spark. Option D is not the best solution  as creating an AWS Glue Data Catalog  configuring an AWS Glue Schema Registry  creating AWS Lambda user defined functions (UDFs) by using the Amazon Redshift Data API  and creating an AWS Step Functions job to orchestrate the ingestion of the data that the analytics department will use into Amazon Redshift Serverless  would incur more costs and complexity than using Athena and Spark. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers13. AWS Lambda UDFs are Lambda functions that you can invoke from within an Amazon Redshift query. Amazon Redshift Data API is a service that allows you to run SQL statements on Amazon Redshift clusters using HTTP requests  without needing a persistent connection. AWS Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows. While these services are powerful and useful for many data engineering scenarios  they are not necessary or cost- effective for creating a data catalog and indexing the IoT data in Amazon S3. AWS Glue Data Catalog and Schema Registry charge you based on the number of objects stored and the number of requests made67. AWS Lambda charges you based on the number of requests and the duration of your functions13. Amazon Redshift Serverless charges you based on the amount of data scanned by your queries and the compute time used by your workloads9. AWS Step Functions charges you based on the number of state transitions in your workflows. These costs can add up quickly  especially if you have large volumes of IoT data and frequent schema changes. Moreover  using AWS Glue  AWS Lambda  Amazon Redshift Data API  and AWS Step Functions would introduce additional latency and complexity  as you would have to create and invoke Lambda functions to ingest the data from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift Serverless using the Data API  and coordinate the ingestion process using Step Functions instead of querying it directly from Amazon S3 using Athena and Spark.

A company is migrating its database servers from Amazon EC2 instances that run Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server DB instances. The company's analytics team must export large data elements every day until the migration is complete. The data elements are the result of SQL joinsacross multiple tables. The data must be in Apache Parquet format. The analytics team must store the data in Amazon S3. Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?,A. Create a view in the EC2 instance-based SQL Server databases that contains the required data element,B. Create an AWS Glue job that selects the data directly from the view and transfers the data in Parquet format to an S3 bucke,C. Schedule the AWS Glue job to run every day.,D. Schedule SQL Server Agent to run a daily SQL query that selects the desired data elements from the EC2 instance-based SQL Server database,E. Configure the query to direct the output .csv objects to an S3 bucke,F. Create an S3 event that invokes an AWS Lambda function to transform the output format from .csv to Parquet. G. Use a SQL query to create a view in the EC2 instance-based SQL Server databases that contains the required data element H. Create and run an AWS Glue crawler to read the vie I. Create an AWS Glue job that retrieves the data and transfers the data in Parquet format to an S3 bucke J. Schedule the AWS Glue job to run every day. K. Create an AWS Lambda function that queries the EC2 instance-based databases by using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). Configure the Lambda function to retrieve the required data  transform the data into Parquet format  and transfer the data into an S3 bucke L. Use Amazon EventBridge to schedule the Lambda function to run every day.,1,radio,,,Option A is the most operationally efficient way to meet the requirements because it minimizes the number of steps and services involved in the data export process. AWS Glue is a fully managed service that can extract  transform  and load (ETL) data from various sources to various destinations  including Amazon S3. AWS Glue can also convert data to different formats  such as Parquet  which is a columnar storage format that is optimized for analytics. By creating a view in the SQL Server databases that contains the required data elements  the AWS Glue job can select the data directly from the view without having to perform any joins or transformations on the source data. The AWS Glue job can then transfer the data in Parquet format to an S3 bucket and run on a daily schedule. Option B is not operationally efficient because it involves multiple steps and services to export the data. SQL Server Agent is a tool that can run scheduled tasks on SQL Server databases  such as executing SQL queries. However  SQL Server Agent cannot directly export data to S3  so the query output must be saved as .csv objects on the EC2 instance. Then  an S3 event must be configured to trigger an AWS Lambda function that can transform the .csv objects to Parquet format and upload them to S3. This option adds complexity and latency to the data export process and requires additional resources and configuration. Option C is not operationally efficient because it introduces an unnecessary step of running an AWS Glue crawler to read the view. An AWS Glue crawler is a service that can scan data sources and create metadata tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. The Data Catalog is a central repository that stores information about the data sources  such as schema  format  and location. However  in this scenario  the schema and format of the data elements are already known and fixed  so there is no need to run a crawler to discover them. The AWS Glue job can directly select the data from the view without using the Data Catalog. Running a crawler adds extra time and cost to the data export process. Option D is not operationally efficient because it requires custom code and configuration to query the databases and transform the data. An AWS Lambda function is a service that can run code in response to events or triggers  such as Amazon EventBridge. Amazon EventBridge is a service that can connect applications and services with event sources  such as schedules  and route them to targets  such as Lambda functions. However  in this scenario  using a Lambda function to query the databases and transform the data is not the best option because it requires writing and maintaining code that uses JDBC to connect to the SQL Server databases  retrieve the required data  convert the data to Parquet format  and transfer the data to S3. This option also has limitations on the execution time memory  and concurrency of the Lambda function  which may affect the performance and reliability of the data export process. References: ?

A company needs to partition the Amazon S3 storage that the company uses for a data lake. The partitioning will use a path of the S3 object keys in the following format: s3://bucket/prefix/year=2023/month=01/day=01. A data engineer must ensure that the AWS Glue Data Catalog synchronizes with the S3 storage when the company adds new partitions to the bucket. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST latency?,A. Schedule an AWS Glue crawler to run every morning.,B. Manually run the AWS Glue CreatePartition API twice each day.,C. Use code that writes data to Amazon S3 to invoke the Boto3 AWS Glue create partition API call.,D. Run the MSCK REPAIR TABLE command from the AWS Glue console.,,,3,radio,,,The best solution to ensure that the AWS Glue Data Catalog synchronizes with the S3 storage when the company adds new partitions to the bucket with the least latency is to use code that writes data to Amazon S3 to invoke the Boto3 AWS Glue create partition API call. This way  the Data Catalog is updated as soon as new data is written to S3  and the partition information is immediately available for querying by other services. The Boto3 AWS Glue create partition API call allows you to create a new partition in the Data Catalog by specifying the table name  the database name and the partition values1. You can use this API call in your code that writes data to S3  such as a Python script or an AWS Glue ETL job  to create a partition for each new S3 object key that matches the partitioning scheme. Option A is not the best solution  as scheduling an AWS Glue crawler to run every morning would introduce a significant latency between the time new data is written to S3 and the time the Data Catalog is updated. AWS Glue crawlers are processes that connect to a data store  progress through a prioritized list of classifiers to determine the schema for your data  and then create metadata tables in the Data Catalog2. Crawlers can be scheduled to run periodically  such as daily or hourly  but they cannot runcontinuously or in real-time. Therefore  using a crawler to synchronize the Data Catalog with the S3 storage would not meet the requirement of the least latency. Option B is not the best solution  as manually running the AWS Glue CreatePartition API twice each day would also introduce a significant latency between the time new data is written to S3 and the time the Data Catalog is updated. Moreover  manually running the API would require more operational overhead and human intervention than using code that writes data to S3 to invoke the API automatically.

The MSCK REPAIR TABLE command is a SQL command that you can run in the AWS Glue console to add partitions to the Data Catalog based on the S3 object keys that match the partitioning scheme3. However  this command is not meant to be run frequently or in real-time  as it can take a long time to scan the entire S3 bucket and add the partitions.

A company uses Amazon RDS for MySQL as the database for a critical application. The database workload is mostly writes  with a small number of reads. A data engineer notices that the CPU utilization of the DB instance is very high. The high CPU utilization is slowing down the application. The data engineer must reduce the CPU utilization of the DB Instance. Which actions should the data engineer take to meet this requirement? (Choose two.),A. Use the Performance Insights feature of Amazon RDS to identify queries that have high CPU utilizatio,B. Optimize the problematic queries.,C. Modify the database schema to include additional tables and indexes.,D. Reboot the RDS DB instance once each week.,E. Upgrade to a larger instance size.,F. Implement caching to reduce the database query load.,1,radio,,,Amazon RDS is a fully managed service that provides relational databases in the cloud. Amazon RDS for MySQL is one of the supported database engines that you can use to run your applications. Amazon RDS provides various features and tools to monitor and optimize the performance of your DB instances  such as Performance Insights  Enhanced Monitoring  CloudWatch metrics and alarms  etc. Using the Performance Insights feature of Amazon RDS to identify queries that have high CPU utilization and optimizing the problematic queries will help reduce the CPU utilization of the DB instance. Performance Insights is a feature that allows you to analyze the load on your DB instance and determine what is causing performance issues. Performance Insights collects  analyzes  and displays database performance data using an interactive dashboard. You can use Performance Insights to identify the top SQL statements  hosts  users  or processes that are consuming the most CPU resources. You can also drill down into the details of each query and see the execution plan  wait events  locks  etc. By using Performance Insights  you can pinpoint the root cause of the high CPU utilization and optimize the queries accordingly. For example  you can rewrite the queries to make them more efficient  add or remove indexes  use prepared statements  etc. Implementing caching to reduce the database query load will also help reduce the CPU utilization of the DB instance. Caching is a technique that allows you to store frequently accessed data in a fast and scalable storage layer  such as Amazon ElastiCache. By using caching  you can reduce the number of requests that hit your database  which in turn reduces the CPU load on your DB instance. Caching also improves the performance and availability of your application  as it reduces the latency and increases the throughput of your data access. You can use caching for various scenarios  such as storing session data  user preferences application configuration  etc. You can also use caching for read-heavy workloads  such as displaying product details  recommendations  reviews  etc. The other options are not as effective as using Performance Insights and caching. Modifying the database schema to include additional tables and indexes may or may not improve the CPU utilization  depending on the nature of the workload and the queries. Adding more tables and indexes may increase the complexity and overhead of the database  which may negatively affect the performance. Rebooting the RDS DB instance once each week will not reduce the CPU utilization  as it will not address the underlying cause of the high CPU load. Rebooting may also cause downtime and disruption to your application. Upgrading to a larger instance size may reduce the CPUutilization  but it will also increase the cost and complexity of your solution. Upgrading may also not be necessary if you can optimize the queries and reduce the database load by using caching. References: ? Amazon RDS ? Performance Insights ? Amazon ElastiCache ?

A data engineer must orchestrate a series of Amazon Athena queries that will run every day. Each query can run for more than 15 minutes. Which combination of steps will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? (Choose two.),A. Use an AWS Lambda function and the Athena Boto3 client start_query_execution API call to invoke the Athena queries programmatically.,B. Create an AWS Step Functions workflow and add two state,C. Add the first state before the Lambda functio,D. Configure the second state as a Wait state to periodically check whether the Athena query has finished using the Athena Boto3 get_query_execution API cal,E. Configure the workflow to invoke the next query when the current query has finished running.,F. Use an AWS Glue Python shell job and the Athena Boto3 client start_query_execution API call to invoke the Athena queries programmatically. G. Use an AWS Glue Python shell script to run a sleep timer that checks every 5 minutes to determine whether the current Athena query has finished running successfull H. Configure the Python shell script to invoke the next query when the current query has finished running. I. Use Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (Amazon MWAA) to orchestrate the Athena queries in AWS Batch.,1,radio,,,Option A and B are the correct answers because they meet the requirements most cost-effectively. Using an AWS Lambda function and the Athena Boto3 client start_query_execution API call to invoke the Athena queries programmatically is a simple and scalable way to orchestrate the queries. Creating an AWS Step Functions workflow and adding two states to check the query status and invoke the next query is a reliable and efficient way to handle the long-running queries. Option C is incorrect because using an AWS Glue Python shell job to invoke the Athena queries programmatically is more expensive than using a Lambda function  as it requires provisioning and running a Glue job for each query. Option D is incorrect because using an AWS Glue Python shell script to run a sleep timer that checks every 5 minutes to determine whether the current Athena query has finished running successfully is not a cost-effective or reliable way to orchestrate the queries  as it wastes resources and time. Option E is incorrect because using Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (Amazon MWAA) to orchestrate the Athena queries in AWS Batch is an overkill solution that introduces unnecessary complexity and cost  as it requires setting up and managing an Airflow environment and an AWS Batch compute environment.

A data engineer needs to create an AWS Lambda function that converts the format of data from .csv to Apache Parquet. The Lambda function must run only if a user uploads a .csv file to an Amazon S3 bucket. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?,A. Create an S3 event notification that has an event type of s3:ObjectCreated:*. Use a filter rule to generate notifications only when the suffix includes .cs,B. Set the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function as the destination for the event notification.,C. Create an S3 event notification that has an event type of s3:ObjectTagging:* for objects that have a tag set to .cs,D. Set the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function as the destination for the event notification.,E. Create an S3 event notification that has an event type of s3:*. Use a filter rule to generate notifications only when the suffix includes .cs,F. Set the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function as the destination for the event notification. G. Create an S3 event notification that has an event type of s3:ObjectCreated:*. Use a filter rule to generate notifications only when the suffix includes .cs H. Set an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as the destination for the event notificatio I. Subscribe the Lambda function to the SNS topic.,1,radio,,,Option A is the correct answer because it meets the requirements with the least operational overhead. Creating an S3 event notification that has an event type of s3:ObjectCreated:* will trigger the Lambda function whenever a new object is created in the S3 bucket. Using a filter rule to generate notifications only when the suffix includes .csv will ensure that the Lambda function only runs for .csv files. Setting the ARN of the Lambda function as the destination for the event notification will directly invoke the Lambda function without any additional steps. Option B is incorrect because it requires the user to tag the objects with .csv  which adds an extra step and increases the operational overhead. Option C is incorrect because it uses an event type of s3:*  which will trigger the Lambda function for any S3 event  not just object creation. This could result in unnecessary invocations and increased costs. Option D is incorrect because it involves creating and subscribing to an SNS topic  which adds an extra layer of complexity and operational overhead. References: ?

A company is planning to migrate on-premises Apache Hadoop clusters to Amazon EMR. The company also needs to migrate a data catalog into a persistent storage solution. The company currently stores the data catalog in an on-premises Apache Hive metastore on the Hadoop clusters. The company requires a serverless solution to migrate the data catalog. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?,A. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to migrate the Hive metastore into Amazon S3. Configure AWS Glue Data Catalog to scan Amazon S3 to produce the data catalog.,B. Configure a Hive metastore in Amazon EM,C. Migrate the existing on-premises Hive metastore into Amazon EM,D.

Migrate the existing on-premises Hive metastore into Amazon EM J. Use the new metastore as the company's data catalog.,1,radio,,,AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a service that helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. You can use AWS DMS to migrate the Hive metastore from the on-premises Hadoop clusters into Amazon S3  which is a highlyscalable  durable  and cost-effective object storage service. AWS Glue Data Catalog is a serverless  managed service that acts as a central metadata repository for your data assets. You can use AWS Glue Data Catalog to scan the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the migrated Hive metastore and create a data catalog that is compatible with Apache Hive and other AWS services. This solution meets the requirements of migrating the data catalog into a persistent storage solution and using a serverless solution. This solution is also the most cost-effective as it does not incur any additional charges for running Amazon EMR or Amazon Aurora MySQL clusters. The other options are either not feasible or not optimal. Configuring a Hive metastore in Amazon EMR (option B) or an external Hive metastore in Amazon EMR (option C) would require running and maintaining Amazon EMR clusters  which would incur additional costs and complexity. Using Amazon Aurora MySQL to store the company’s data catalog (option C) would also incur additional costs and complexity  as well as introduce compatibility issues with Apache Hive. Configuring a new Hive metastore in Amazon EMR (option D) would not migrate the existing data catalog  but create a new one  which would result in data loss and inconsistency. References: ?

Increase the provisioned capacity to the maximum capacity that is currently present during peak load times.,B. Divide the table into two table,C. Provision each table with half of the provisioned capacity of the original tabl,D. Spread queries evenly across both tables.,E. Use AWS Application Auto Scaling to schedule higher provisioned capacity for peak usage time,F. Schedule lower capacity during off-peak times. G. Change the capacity mode from provisioned to on-deman H. Configure the table to scale up and scale down based on the load on the table.,3,radio,,,Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB offers two capacity modes for throughput capacity: provisioned and on-demand. In provisioned capacity mode  you specify the number of read and write capacity units per second that you expect your application to require. DynamoDB reserves the resources to meet your throughput needs with consistent performance. In on-demand capacity mode  you pay per request and DynamoDB scales the resources up and down automatically based on the actual workload. On-demand capacity mode is suitable for unpredictable workloads that can vary significantly over time1. The solution that meets the requirements in the most cost-effective way is to use AWS Application Auto Scaling to schedule higher provisioned capacity for peak usage times and lower capacity during off-peak times. This solution has the following advantages: ? It allows you to optimize the cost and performance of your DynamoDB table by adjusting the provisioned capacity according to your predictable workload patterns. You can use scheduled scaling to specify the date and time for the scaling actions  and the new minimum and maximum capacity limits. For example you can schedule higher capacity for every Monday morning and lower capacity for weekends2. ? It enables you to take advantage of the lower cost per unit of provisioned capacity mode compared to on-demand capacity mode. Provisioned capacity mode charges a flat hourly rate for the capacity you reserve  regardless of how much you use. On-demand capacity mode charges for each read and write request you consume  with nominimum capacity required. For predictable workloads  provisioned capacity mode can be more cost-effective than on-demand capacity mode1. ? It ensures that your application performs consistently during peak usage times by having enough capacity to handle the increased load. You can also use auto scaling to automatically adjust the provisioned capacity based on the actual utilization of your table  and set a target utilization percentage for your table or global secondary index. This way  you can avoid under-provisioning or over- provisioning your table2. Option A is incorrect because it suggests increasing the provisioned capacity to the maximum capacity that is currently present during peak load times. This solution has the following disadvantages: ? It wastes money by paying for unused capacity during off-peak times. If you provision the same high capacity for all times  regardless of the actual workload  you are over-provisioning your table and paying for resources that you don’t need1. ? It does not account for possible changes in the workload patterns over time. If your peak load times increase or decrease in the future  you may need to manually adjust the provisioned capacity to match the new demand. This adds operational overhead and complexity to your application2. Option B is incorrect because it suggests dividing the table into two tables and provisioning each table with half of the provisioned capacity of the original table. This solution has the following disadvantages: ? It complicates the data model and the application logic by splitting the data into two separate tables. You need to ensure that the queries are evenly distributed across both tables  and that the data is consistent and synchronized between them. This adds extra development and maintenance effort to your application3. ? It does not solve the problem of adjusting the provisioned capacity according to the workload patterns. You still need to manually or automatically scale the capacity of each table based on the actual utilization and demand. This may result in under- provisioning or over-provisioning your tables2. Option D is incorrect because it suggests changing the capacity mode from provisioned to on-demand. This solution has the following disadvantages: ? It may incur higher costs than provisioned capacity mode for predictable workloads. On-demand capacity mode charges for each read and write request you consume  with no minimum capacity required. For predictable workloads  provisioned capacity mode can be more cost-effective than on-demand capacity mode as you can reserve the capacity you need at a lower rate1. ? It may not provide consistent performance during peak usage times  as on-demand capacity mode may take some time to scale up the resources to meet the sudden increase in demand. On-demand capacity mode uses adaptive capacity to handle bursts of traffic  but it may not be able to handle very large spikes or sustained high throughput. In such cases  you may experience throttling or increased latency.

A company uses an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server database to store financial transaction data. The company migrates the transaction data from the onpremises database to AWS at the end of each month. The company has noticed that the cost to migrate data from the on-premises database to an Amazon RDS for SQL Server database has increased recently. The company requires a cost-effective solution to migrate the data to AWS. The solution must cause minimal downtown for the applications that access the database. Which AWS service should the company use to meet these requirements?,A. AWS Lambda,B. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS),C. AWS Direct Connect,D. AWS DataSync,,,2,radio,,,AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a cloud service that makes it possible to migrate relational databases  data warehouses  NoSQL databases  and other types of data stores to AWS quickly  securely  and with minimal downtime and zero data loss1. AWS DMS supports migration between 20-plus database and analytics engines  such as Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon RDS for SQL Server2. AWS DMS takes overmany of the difficult or tedious tasks involved in a migration project  such as capacity analysis  hardware and software procurement  installation and administration  testing and debugging  and ongoing replication and monitoring1. AWS DMS is a cost-effective solution  as you only pay for the compute resources and additional log storage used during the migration process2. AWS DMS is the best solution for the company to migrate the financial transaction data from the on-premises Microsoft SQL Server database to AWS  as it meets the requirements of minimal downtime  zero data loss  and low cost. Option A is not the best solution  as AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers  but it does not provide any built-in features for database migration. You would have to write your own code to extract  transform  and load the data from the source to the target which would increase the operational overhead and complexity. Option C is not the best solution  as AWS Direct Connect is a service that establishes a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS  but it does not provide any built-in features for database migration. You would still need to use another service or tool to perform the actual data transfer  which would increase the cost and complexity. Option D is not the best solution  as AWS DataSync is a service that makes it easy to transfer data between on-premises storage systems and AWS storage services  such as Amazon S3  Amazon EFS  and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server  but it does not support Amazon RDS for SQL Server as a target. You would have to use another service or tool to migrate the data from Amazon S3 to Amazon RDS for SQL Server  which would increase the latency and complexity. References: ?

A data engineer must ingest a source of structured data that is in .csv format into an Amazon S3 data lake. The .csv files contain 15 columns. Data analysts need to run Amazon Athena queries on one or two columns of the dataset. The data analysts rarely query the entire file. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?,A. Use an AWS Glue PySpark job to ingest the source data into the data lake in .csv format.,B. Create an AWS Glue extract  transform  and load (ETL) job to read from the .csv structured data sourc,C. Configure the job to ingest the data into the data lake in JSON format.,D. Use an AWS Glue PySpark job to ingest the source data into the data lake in Apache Avro format.,E. Create an AWS Glue extract  transform  and load (ETL) job to read from the .csv structured data sourc,F. Configure the job to write the data into the data lake in Apache Parquet format.,4,radio,,,Amazon Athena is a serverless interactive query service that allows you to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena supports various data formats  such as CSV JSON  ORC  Avro  and Parquet. However  not all data formats are equally efficient for querying. Some data formats  such as CSV and JSON  are row-oriented  meaning that they store data as a sequence of records  each with the same fields. Row- oriented formats are suitable for loading and exporting data  but they are not optimal for analytical queries that often access only a subset of columns. Row-oriented formats also do not support compression or encoding techniques that can reduce the data size and improve the query performance. On the other hand  some data formats  such as ORC and Parquet  are column-oriented  meaning that they store data as a collection of columns  each with a specific data type. Column-oriented formats are ideal for analytical queries that often filter  aggregate  or join data by columns. Column-oriented formats also support compression and encoding techniques that can reduce the data size and improve the query performance. For example  Parquet supports dictionary encoding  which replaces repeated values with numeric codes  and run-length encoding  which replaces consecutive identical values with a single value and a count. Parquet also supports various compression algorithms  such as Snappy  GZIP  and ZSTD  that can further reduce the data size and improve the query performance. Therefore  creating an AWS Glue extract  transform  and load (ETL) job to read from the .csv structured data source and writing the data into the data lake in Apache Parquet format will meet the requirements most cost-effectively. AWS Glue is a fully managed service that provides a serverless data integration platform for data preparation  data cataloging  and data loading. AWS Glue ETL jobs allow you to transform and load data from various sources into various targets  using either a graphical interface (AWS Glue Studio) or a code-based interface (AWS Glue console or AWS Glue API). By using AWS Glue ETL jobs  you can easily convert the data from CSV to Parquet format  without having to write or manage any code. Parquet is a column-oriented format that allows Athena to scan only the relevant columns and skip the rest  reducing the amount of data read from S3. This solution will also reduce the cost of Athena queries  as Athena charges based on the amount of data scanned from S3. The other options are not as cost-effective as creating an AWS Glue ETL job to write the data into the data lake in Parquet format. Using an AWS Glue PySpark job to ingest the source data into the data lake in .csv format will not improve the query performance or reduce the query cost  as .csv is a row-oriented format that does not support columnar access or compression. Creating an AWS Glue ETL job to ingest the data into the data lake in JSON format will not improve the query performance or reduce the query cost  as JSON is also a row-oriented format that does not support columnar access or compression. Using an AWS Glue PySpark job to ingest the source data into the data lake in Apache Avro format will improve the query performance  as Avro is a column-oriented format that supports compression and encoding  but it will require more operational effort  as you will need to write and maintain PySpark code to convert the data from CSV to Avro format.

Initiate a REST API call to dynamically redact PII based on the needs of each application that accesses the data.,2,radio,,,Option B is the best solution to meet the requirements with the least operational overhead because S3 Object Lambda is a feature that allows you to add your own code to process data retrieved from S3 before returning it to an application. S3 Object Lambda works with S3 GET requests and can modify both the object metadata and the object data. By using S3 Object Lambda  you can implement redaction logic within an S3 Object Lambda function to dynamically redact PII based on the needs of each application that accesses the data. This way  you can avoid creating and maintaining multiple copies of the dataset with different levels of redaction. Option A is not a good solution because it involves creating and managing multiple copies of the dataset with different levels of redaction for each application. This option adds complexity and storage cost to the data protection process and requires additional resources and configuration. Moreover  S3 bucket policies cannot enforce fine-grained data access control at the row and column level  so they are not sufficient to redact PII. Option C is not a good solution because it involves using AWS Glue to transform the data for each application. AWS Glue is a fully managed service that can extract  transform  and load (ETL) data from various sources to various destinations  including S3. AWS Glue can also convert data to different formats  such as Parquet  which is a columnar storage format that is optimized for analytics. However  in this scenario  using AWS Glue to redact PII is not the best option because it requires creating and maintaining multiple copies of the dataset with different levels of redaction for each application. This option also adds extra time and cost to the data protection process and requires additional resources and configuration. Option D is not a good solution because it involves creating and configuring an API Gateway endpoint that has custom authorizers. API Gateway is a service that allows youto create  publish  maintain  monitor  and secure APIs at any scale. API Gateway can also integrate with other AWS services  such as Lambda  to provide custom logic for processing requests. However  in this scenario  using API Gateway to redact PII is not the best option because it requires writing and maintaining custom code and configuration for the API endpoint  the custom authorizers  and the REST API call. This option also adds complexity and latency to the data protection process and requires additional resources and configuration. References: ?

A retail company has a customer data hub in an Amazon S3 bucket. Employees from many countries use the data hub to support company-wide analytics. A governance team must ensure that the company's data analysts can access data only for customers who are within the same country as the analysts. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational effort?,A. Create a separate table for each country's customer dat,B. Provide access to each analyst based on the country that the analyst serves.,C. Register the S3 bucket as a data lake location in AWS Lake Formatio,D. Use the Lake Formation row-level security features to enforce the company's access policies.,E. Move the data to AWS Regions that are close to the countries where the customers ar,F. Provide access to each analyst based on the country that the analyst serves. G. Load the data into Amazon Redshif H. Create a view for each countr I. Create separate 1AM roles for each country to provide access to data from each countr J. Assign the appropriate roles to the analysts.,2,radio,,,AWS Lake Formation is a service that allows you to easily set up  secure  and manage data lakes. One of the features of Lake Formation is row-level security which enables you to control access to specific rows or columns of data based on the identity or role of the user. This feature is useful for scenarios where you need to restrict access to sensitive or regulated data  such as customer data from different countries. By registering the S3 bucket as a data lake location in Lake Formation  you can use the Lake Formation console or APIs to define and apply row-level security policies to the data in the bucket. You can also use Lake Formation blueprints to automate the ingestion and transformation of data from various sources into the data lake. This solution requires the least operational effort compared to the other options  as it does not involve creating or moving data  or managing multiple tables  views  or roles. References: ?

A data engineer runs Amazon Athena queries on data that is in an Amazon S3 bucket. The Athena queries use AWS Glue Data Catalog as a metadata table. The data engineer notices that the Athena query plans are experiencing a performance bottleneck. The data engineer determines that the cause of the performance bottleneck is the large number of partitions that are in the S3 bucket. The data engineer must resolve the performance bottleneck and reduce Athena query planning time. Which solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

Use Athena partition projection based on the S3 bucket prefix.,E. Transform the data that is in the S3 bucket to Apache Parquet format.,F. Use the Amazon EMR S3DistCP utility to combine smaller objects in the S3 bucket into larger objects.,1,radio,,,The best solutions to resolve the performance bottleneck and reduce Athena query planning time are to create an AWS Glue partition index and enable partition filtering  and to use Athena partition projection based on the S3 bucket prefix. AWS Glue partition indexes are a feature that allows you to speed up query processing of highly partitioned tables cataloged in AWS Glue Data Catalog. Partition indexes are available for queries in Amazon EMR  Amazon Redshift Spectrum  and AWS Glue ETL jobs. Partition indexes are sublists of partition keys defined in the table. When you create a partition index  you specify a list of partition keys that already exist on a given table. AWS Glue then creates an index for the specified keys and stores it in the Data Catalog. When you run a query that filters on the partition keys  AWS Glue uses the partition index to quickly identify the relevant partitions without scanning the entiretable metadata. This reduces the query planning time and improves the query performance1. Athena partition projection is a feature that allows you to speed up query processing of highly partitioned tables and automate partition management. In partition projection  Athena calculates partition values and locations using the table properties that you configure directly on your table in AWS Glue. The table properties allow Athena to ‘project’  or determine  the necessary partition information instead of having to do a more time- consuming metadata lookup in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Because in-memory operations are often faster than remote operations  partition projection can reduce the runtime of queries against highly partitioned tables. Partition projection also automates partition management because it removes the need to manually create partitions in Athena  AWS Glue  or your external Hive metastore2. Option B is not the best solution  as bucketing the data based on a column that the data have in common in a WHERE clause of the user query would not reduce the query planning time. Bucketing is a technique that divides data into buckets based on a hash function applied to a column. Bucketing can improve the performance of join queries by reducing the amount of data that needs to be shuffled between nodes. However  bucketing does not affect the partition metadata retrieval  which is the main cause of the performance bottleneck in this scenario3. Option D is not the best solution  as transforming the data that is in the S3 bucket to Apache Parquet format would not reduce the query planning time. Apache Parquet is a columnar storage format that can improve the performance of analytical queries by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned and providing efficient compression and encoding schemes. However  Parquet does not affect the partition metadata retrieval  which is the main cause of the performance bottleneck in this scenario4. Option E is not the best solution  as using the Amazon EMR S3DistCP utility to combine smaller objects in the S3 bucket into larger objects would not reduce the query planning time. S3DistCP is a tool that can copy large amounts of data between Amazon S3 buckets or from HDFS to Amazon S3. S3DistCP can also aggregate smaller files into larger files to improve the performance of sequential access. However  S3DistCP does not affect the partition metadata retrieval  which is the main cause of the performance bottleneck in this scenario5. References: ?

A data engineer is using Amazon Athena to analyze sales data that is in Amazon S3. The data engineer writes a query to retrieve sales amounts for 2023 for several products from a table named sales_data. However  the query does not return results for all of the products that are in the sales_data table. The data engineer needs to troubleshoot the query to resolve the issue. The data engineer's original query is as follows: SELECT product_name  sum(sales_amount) FROM sales_data WHERE year = 2023 GROUP BY product_name How should the data engineer modify the Athena query to meet these requirements?,A. Replace sum(sales amount) with count(*J for the aggregation.,B. Change WHERE year = 2023 to WHERE extractlyear FROM sales data) = 2023.,C. Add HAVING sumfsales amount) > 0 after the GROUP BY clause.,D. Remove the GROUP BY clause,,,2,radio,,,The original query does not return results for all of the products because the year column in the sales_data table is not an integer  but a timestamp. Therefore  the WHERE clause does not filter the data correctly  and only returns the products that have a null value for the year column. To fix this  the data engineer should use the extract function to extract the year from the timestamp and compare it with 2023. This way  the querywill return the correct results for all of the products in the sales_data table. The other options are either incorrect or irrelevant  as they do not address the root cause of the issue. Replacing sum with count does not change the filtering condition  adding HAVING clause does not affect the grouping logic  and removing the GROUP BY clause does not solve the problem of missing products.

A data engineer has a one-time task to read data from objects that are in Apache Parquet format in an Amazon S3 bucket. The data engineer needs to query only one column of the data. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?,A. Confiqure an AWS Lambda function to load data from the S3 bucket into a pandas dataframe- Write a SQL SELECT statement on the dataframe to query the required column.,B. Use S3 Select to write a SQL SELECT statement to retrieve the required column from the S3 objects.,C. Prepare an AWS Glue DataBrew project to consume the S3 objects and to query the required column.,D. Run an AWS Glue crawler on the S3 object,E.

Get the Full AWS-Certified-Data-Engineer-Associate dumps in VCE and PDF From SurePassExam https://www.surepassexam.com/AWS-Certified-Data-Engineer-Associate-exam-dumps.html (80 New Questions),,2,radio,,,Option B is the best solution to meet the requirements with the least operational overhead because S3 Select is a feature that allows you to retrieve only a subset of data from an S3 object by using simple SQL expressions. S3 Select works on objects stored in CSV  JSON  or Parquet format. By using S3 Select  you can avoid the need to download and process the entire S3 object  which reduces the amount of data transferred and the computation time. S3 Select is also easy to use and does not require any additional services or resources. Option A is not a good solution because it involves writing custom code and configuring an AWS Lambda function to load data from the S3 bucket into a pandas dataframe and query the required column. This option adds complexity and latency to the data retrieval process and requires additional resources and configuration.Moreover  AWS Lambda has limitations on the execution time  memory  and concurrency  which may affect the performance and reliability of the data retrieval process. Option C is not a good solution because it involves creating and running an AWS Glue DataBrew project to consume the S3 objects and query the required column. AWS Glue DataBrew is a visual data preparation tool that allows you to clean  normalize  and transform data without writing code. However  in this scenario  the data is already in Parquet format  which is a columnar storage format that is optimized for analytics. Therefore  there is no need to use AWS Glue DataBrew to prepare the data. Moreover  AWS Glue DataBrew adds extra time and cost to the data retrieval process and requires additional resources and configuration. Option D is not a good solution because it involves running an AWS Glue crawler on the S3 objects and using a SQL SELECT statement in Amazon Athena to query the required column. An AWS Glue crawler is a service that can scan data sources and create metadata tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. The Data Catalog is a central repository that stores information about the data sources  such as schema  format  and location. Amazon Athena is a serverless interactive query service that allows you to analyze data in S3 using standard SQL. However  in this scenario  the schema and format of the data are already known and fixed  so there is no need to run a crawler to discover them. Moreover  running a crawler and using Amazon Athena adds extra time and cost to the data retrieval process and requires additional services and configuration. References: ?

A data engineer needs to maintain a central metadata repository that users access through Amazon EMR and Amazon Athena queries. The repository needs to provide the schema and properties of many tables. Some of the metadata is stored in Apache Hive. The data engineer needs to import the metadata from Hive into the central metadata repository. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?,A. Use Amazon EMR and Apache Ranger.,B. Use a Hive metastore on an EMR cluster.,C. Use the AWS Glue Data Catalog.,D. Use a metastore on an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance.,,,3,radio,,,The AWS Glue Data Catalog is an Apache Hive metastore-compatible catalog that provides a central metadata repository for various data sources and formats. You can use the AWS Glue Data Catalog as an external Hive metastore for Amazon EMR and Amazon Athena queries  and import metadata from existing Hive metastores into the Data Catalog. This solution requires the least development effort  as you can use AWS Glue crawlers to automatically discover and catalog the metadata from Hive  and use the AWS Glue console  AWS CLI  or Amazon EMR API to configure the Data Catalog as the Hive metastore. The other options are either more complex or require additional steps  such as setting up Apache Ranger for security  managing a Hive metastore on an EMR cluster or an RDS instance  or migrating the metadata manually.

A data engineer needs to use AWS Step Functions to design an orchestration workflow. The workflow must parallel process a large collection of data files and apply a specific transformation to each file. Which Step Functions state should the data engineer use to meet these requirements?,A. Parallel state,B. Choice state,C. Map state,D. Wait state,,,3,radio,,,Option C is the correct answer because the Map state is designed to process a collection of data in parallel by applying the same transformation to each element. The Map state can invoke a nested workflow for each element  which can be another state machine ora Lambda function. The Map state will wait until all the parallel executions are completed before moving to the next state. Option A is incorrect because the Parallel state is used to execute multiple branches of logic concurrently  not to process a collection of data. The Parallel state can have different branches with different logic and states  whereas the Map state has only one branch that is applied to each element of the collection. Option B is incorrect because the Choice state is used to make decisions based on a comparison of a value to a set of rules. The Choice state does not process any data or invoke any nested workflows. Option D is incorrect because the Wait state is used to delay the state machine from continuing for a specified time. The Wait state does not process any data or invoke any nested workflows.

A company receives call logs as Amazon S3 objects that contain sensitive customer information. The company must protect the S3 objects by using encryption. The company must also use encryption keys that only specific employees can access. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST effort?,A. Use an AWS CloudHSM cluster to store the encryption key,B. Configure the process that writes to Amazon S3 to make calls to CloudHSM to encrypt and decrypt the object,C. Deploy an IAM policy that restricts access to the CloudHSM cluster.,D. Use server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) to encrypt the objects that contain customer informatio,E. Restrict access to the keys that encrypt the objects.,F. Use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) to encrypt the objects that contain customer informatio G. Configure an IAM policy that restricts access to the KMS keys that encrypt the objects. H. Use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) to encrypt the objects that contain customer informatio I. Configure an IAM policy that restricts access to the Amazon S3 managed keys that encrypt the objects.,3,radio,,,Option C is the best solution to meet the requirements with the least effort because server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) is a feature that allows you to encrypt data at rest in Amazon S3 using keys managed by AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). AWS KMS is a fully managed service that enables you to create and manage encryption keys for your AWS services and applications. AWS KMS also allows you to define granular access policies for your keys  such as who can use them to encrypt and decrypt data  and under what conditions. By using SSE-KMS  you canprotect your S3 objects by using encryption keys that only specific employees can access  without having to manage the encryption and decryption process yourself. Option A is not a good solution because it involves using AWS CloudHSM  which is a service that provides hardware security modules (HSMs) in the AWS Cloud. AWS CloudHSM allows you to generate and use your own encryption keys on dedicated hardware that is compliant with various standards and regulations. However  AWS CloudHSM is not a fully managed service and requires more effort to set up and maintain than AWS KMS. Moreover  AWS CloudHSM does not integrate with Amazon S3  so you have to configure the process that writes to S3 to make calls to CloudHSM to encrypt and decrypt the objects  which adds complexity and latency to the data protection process. Option B is not a good solution because it involves using server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)  which is a feature that allows you to encrypt data at rest in Amazon S3 using keys that you provide and manage yourself. SSE-C requires you to send your encryption key along with each request to upload or retrieve an object. However  SSE-C does not provide any mechanism to restrict access to the keys that encrypt the objects  so you have to implement your own key management and access control system  which adds more effort and risk to the data protection process. Option D is not a good solution because it involves using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)  which is a feature that allows you to encrypt data at rest in Amazon S3 using keys that are managed by Amazon S3. SSE-S3 automatically encrypts and decrypts your objects as they are uploaded and downloaded from S3. However  SSE-S3 does not allow you to control who can access the encryption keys or under what conditions. SSE-S3 uses a single encryption key for each S3 bucket  which is shared by all users who have access to the bucket. This means that you cannot restrict access to the keys that encrypt the objects by specific employees  which does not meet the requirements. References: ?

A data engineer needs Amazon Athena queries to finish faster. The data engineer notices that all the files the Athena queries use are currently stored in uncompressed .csv format. The data engineer also notices that users perform most queries by selecting a specific column. Which solution will MOST speed up the Athena query performance?,A. Change the data format from .csvto JSON forma,B. Apply Snappy compression.,C. Compress the .csv files by using Snappy compression.,D. Change the data format from .csvto Apache Parque,E. Apply Snappy compression.,F. Compress the .csv files by using gzjg compression.,3,radio,,,Amazon Athena is a serverless interactive query service that allows you to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena supports various data formats  such as CSV  JSON  ORC  Avro  and Parquet. However  not all data formats are equally efficient for querying. Some data formats  such as CSV and JSON  are row-oriented  meaning that they store data as a sequence of records  each with the same fields. Row- oriented formats are suitable for loading and exporting data  but they are not optimal for analytical queries that often access only a subset of columns. Row-oriented formats also do not support compression or encoding techniques that can reduce the data size and improve the query performance. On the other hand  some data formats  such as ORC and Parquet  are column-oriented  meaning that they store data as a collection of columns  each with a specific data type. Column-oriented formats are ideal for analytical queries that often filter  aggregate  or join data by columns. Column-oriented formats also support compression and encoding techniques that can reduce the data size and improve the query performance. For example  Parquet supports dictionary encoding  which replaces repeated values with numeric codes  and run-length encoding  which replaces consecutive identical values with a single value and a count. Parquet also supports various compression algorithms  such as Snappy  GZIP  and ZSTD  that can further reduce the data size and improve the query performance. Therefore  changing the data format from CSV to Parquet and applying Snappy compression will most speed up the Athena query performance. Parquet is a column- oriented format that allows Athena to scan only the relevant columns and skip the rest  reducing the amount of data read from S3. Snappy is a compression algorithm that reduces the data size without compromising the query speed  as it is splittable and does not require decompression before reading. This solution will also reduce the cost of Athena queries  as Athena charges based on the amount of data scanned from S3. The other options are not as effective as changing the data format to Parquet and applying Snappy compression. Changing the data format from CSV to JSON and applying Snappy compression will not improve the query performance significantly  as JSON is also a row- oriented format that does not support columnar access or encoding techniques. Compressing the CSV files by using Snappy compression will reduce the data size  but it will not improve the query performance significantly  as CSV is still a row-oriented format that does not support columnar access or encoding techniques.
