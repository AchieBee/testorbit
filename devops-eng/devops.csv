You need to perform ad-hoc business analytics queries on well-structured data. Data comes in constantly at a high velocity. Your business intelligence team can
understand SQL. What AWS service(s) should you look to first?
A. Kinesis Firehose + RDS
B. Kinesis Firehose + RedShift
C. EMR using Hive
D. EMR running Apache Spark
Answer: B
Explanation:
Kinesis Firehose provides a managed service for aggregating streaming data and inserting it into RedShift. RedShift also supports ad-hoc queries over wellstructured data using a SQL-compliant wire protocol, so the business team should be able to adopt this system easily.

NEW QUESTION 2
What is server immutability?
A. Not updating a server after creation.
B. The ability to change server counts.
C. Updating a server after creation.
D. The inability to change server count
Answer: A
Explanation:
disposable upgrades offer a simpler way to know if your application has unknown dependencies. The underlying EC2 instance usage is considered temporary or
ephemeral in nature for the period of deployment until the current release is active. During the new release, a new set of EC2 instances are rolled out by
terminating older instances. This type of upgrade technique is more common in an immutable infrastructure.

NEW QUESTION 3
You are creating an application which stores extremely sensitive financial information. All information in
the system must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Which of these is a violation of this policy?
A. ELB SSL termination.
B. ELB Using Proxy Protocol v1.
C. CIoudFront Viewer Protocol Policy set to HTTPS redirection.
D. Telling S3 to use AES256 on the server-sid
Answer: A
Explanation:
Terminating SSL terminates the security of a connection over HTTP, removing the S for "Secure" in HTTPS. This violates the "encryption in transit" requirement in
the scenario.

NEW QUESTION 4
When thinking of DynamoDB, what are true of Global Secondary Key properties?
A. The partition key and sort key can be different from the table.
B. Only the partition key can be different from the table.
C. Either the partition key or the sort key can be different from the table, but not both.
D. Only the sort key can be different from the tabl
Answer: A
Explanation:
Global secondary index — an index with a partition key and a sort key that can be different from those on the table. A global secondary index is considered "gIobaI"
because queries on the index can span all of the data in a table, across all partitions.

What is the scope of an EC2 security group?
A. Availability Zone
B. Placement Group
C. Region
D. VPC
Answer: C
Explanation:
A security group is tied to a region and can be assigned only to instances in the same region. You can't enable an instance to communicate with an instance
outside its region using security group rules. Traffic
from an instance in another region is seen as WAN bandwidth.

NEW QUESTION 8
There are a number of ways to purchase compute capacity on AWS. Which orders the price per compute or memory unit from LOW to HIGH (cheapest to most
expensive), on average?
(A) On-Demand (B) Spot (C) Reserved
A. A, B, C
B. C, B, A
C. B, C, A
D. A, C, B
Answer: C
Explanation:
Spot instances are usually many, many times cheaper than on-demand prices. Reserved instances, depending on their term and utilization, can yield
approximately 33% to 66% cost savings. On-Demand prices are the baseline price and are the most expensive way to purchase EC2 compute time. Reference:

NEW QUESTION 9
Which of these techniques enables the fastest possible rollback times in the event of a failed deployment?
A. Rolling; Immutable
B. Rolling; Mutable
C. Canary or A/B
D. Blue-Green
Answer: D
Explanation:
AWS specifically recommends Blue-Green for super-fast, zero-downtime deploys - and thus rollbacks, which are redeploying old code.
You use various strategies to migrate the traffic from your current application stack (blue) to a new version of the application (green). This is a popular technique
for deploying applications with zero downtime. Reference: https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/overview-of-deployment-options-on-aws.pdf

NEW QUESTION 10
You need to know when you spend $1000 or more on AWS. What's the easy way for you to see that notification?
A. AWS CIoudWatch Events tied to API calls, when certain thresholds are exceeded, publish to SNS.
B. Scrape the billing page periodically and pump into Kinesis.
C. AWS CIoudWatch Metrics + Billing Alarm + Lambda event subscriptio
D. When a threshold is exceeded, email the manager.
E. Scrape the billing page periodically and publish to SN
Answer: C
Explanation:
Even if you're careful to stay within the free tier, it's a good idea to create a billing alarm to notify you if you exceed the limits of the free tier. Billing alarms can help
to protect you against unknowingly accruing charges if you inadvertently use a service outside of the free tier or if traffic exceeds your expectations. Reference:

NEW QUESTION 12
You need to migrate 10 million records in one hour into DynamoDB. All records are 1.5KB in size. The data is evenly distributed across the partition key. How
many write capacity units should you provision during this batch load?
A. 6667
B. 4166
C. 5556
D. 2778
Answer: C
Explanation:
You need 2 units to make a 1.5KB write, since you round up. You need 20 million total units to perform this load. You have 3600 seconds to do so. DMde and
round up for 5556.

NEW QUESTION 13
You are experiencing performance issues writing to a DynamoDB table. Your system tracks high scores for video games on a marketplace. Your most popular
game experiences all of the performance issues. What is the most likely problem?
A. DynamoDB's vector clock is out of sync, because of the rapid growth in request for the most popular game.
B. You selected the Game ID or equivalent identifier as the primary partition key for the table.
C. Users of the most popular video game each perform more read and write requests than average.
D. You did not provision enough read or write throughput to the tabl
Answer: B
Explanation:
The primary key selection dramatically affects performance consistency when reading or writing to DynamoDB. By selecting a key that is tied to the identity of the
game, you forced DynamoDB to create a hotspot in the table partitions, and over-request against the primary key partition for the popular game. When it stores
data, DynamoDB dMdes a tabIe's items into multiple partitions, and distributes the data primarily based upon the partition key value. The provisioned throughput
associated with a table is also dMded evenly among the partitions, with no sharing of provisioned throughput across partitions. Reference:

NEW QUESTION 17
You meet once per month with your operations team to review the past month's data. During the meeting, you realize that 3 weeks ago, your monitoring system
which pings over HTTP from outside AWS recorded a large spike in latency on your 3-tier web service API.
You use DynamoDB for the database layer, ELB, EBS, and EC2 for the business logic tier, and SQS, ELB, and EC2 for the presentation layer.
Which of the following techniques will NOT help you figure out what happened?
A. Check your CIoudTraiI log history around the spike's time for any API calls that caused slowness.
B. Review CIoudWatch Metrics graphs to determine which component(s) slowed the system down.
C. Review your ELB access logs in S3 to see if any ELBs in your system saw the latency.
D. Analyze your logs to detect bursts in traffic at that tim
Answer: B
Explanation:
Metrics data are available for 2 weeks. If you want to store metrics data beyond that duration, you can retrieve it using our GetMetricStatistics API as well as a
number of applications and tools offered by AWS partners.

C. Custom resources using Lambda and <code>Code.ZipFiIe</code> allow inline nodejs resource composition.
D. Custom resources using Lambda do not need a <code>ServiceToken</code>property
Answer: C
Explanation:
Code is a property of the AWS::Lambda::Function resource that enables to you specify the source code of an AWS Lambda (Lambda) function. You can point to a
file in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or specify your source code as inline text (for nodejs runtime environments only). Reference:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCIoudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html

NEW QUESTION 22
You need to deploy an AWS stack in a repeatable manner across multiple environments. You have selected CIoudFormation as the right tool to accomplish this,
but have found that there is a resource type you need to create and model, but is unsupported by CIoudFormation. How should you overcome this chaHenge?
A. Use a CIoudFormation Custom Resource Template by selecting an API call to proxy for create, update, and delete action
B. CIoudFormation will use the AWS SDK, CLI, or API method of your choosing as the state transition function for the resource type you are modeling.
C. Submit a ticket to the AWS Forum
D. AWS extends CIoudFormation Resource Types by releasing tooling to the AWS Labs organization on GitHu
E. Their response time is usually 1 day, and they complete requests within a week or two.
F. Instead of depending on CIoudFormation, use Chef, Puppet, or Ansible to author Heat templates, which are declarative stack resource definitions that operate
over the OpenStack hypervisor and cloud environment.
G. Create a CIoudFormation Custom Resource Type by implementing create, update, and delete functionality, either by subscribing a Custom Resource Provider
to an SNS topic, or by implementing the logic in AWS Lambda.
Answer: D
Explanation:
Custom resources provide a way for you to write custom provisioning logic in AWS CIoudFormation template and have AWS CIoudFormation run it during a stack
operation, such as when you create, update or delete a stack. For more information, see Custom Resources.

NEW QUESTION 25
Your CTO has asked you to make sure that you know what all users of your AWS account are doing to change resources at all times. She wants a report of who is
doing what over time, reported to her once per week, for as broad a resource type group as possible. How should you do this?
A. Create a global AWS CIoudTraiI Trai
B. Configure a script to aggregate the log data delivered to S3 once per week and deliver this to the CTO.
C. Use CIoudWatch Events Rules with an SNS topic subscribed to all AWS API call
D. Subscribe the CTO to an email type delivery on this SNS Topic.
E. Use AWS IAM credential reports to deliver a CSV of all uses of IAM User Tokens over time to the CTO.
F. Use AWS Config with an SNS subscription on a Lambda, and insert these changes over time into a DynamoDB tabl
G. Generate reports based on the contents of this table.
Answer: A
Explanation:
This is the ideal use case for AWS CIoudTraiI.
CloudTrai| provides visibility into user actMty by recording API calls made on your account. CIoudTraiI records important information about each API call, including
the name of the API, the identity of the caller, the time of the API call, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS service. This
information helps you to track changes made to your AWS resources and to troubleshoot operational issues. CIoudTraiI makes it easier to ensure compliance with
internal policies and regulatory standards. Reference: https://aws.amazon.com/CloudtraiI/faqs/

NEW QUESTION 27
You need to deploy a new application version to production. Because the deployment is high-risk, you need to roll the new version out to users over a number of
hours, to make sure everything is working correctly. You need to be able to control the proportion of users seeing the new version of the application down to the
percentage point.
You use ELB and EC2 with Auto Scaling Groups and custom AMIs with your code pre-installed assigned to Launch Configurations. There are no database-level
changes during your deployment. You have been told you cannot spend too much money, so you must not increase the number of EC2 instances much at all
during the deployment, but you also need to be able to switch back to the original version of code quickly if something goes wrong. What is the best way to meet
these requirements?
A. Create a second ELB, Auto Scaling Launch Configuration, and Auto Scaling Group using the Launch Configuratio
B. Create AM|s with all code pre-installe

Explanation:
Only Weighted Round Robin DNS Records and reverse proxies allow such fine-grained tuning of traffic splits. The Blue-Green option does not meet the
requirement that we mitigate costs and keep overall EC2 fileet size consistent, so we must select the 2 ELB and ASG option with WRR DNS tuning. This method is
called A/B deployment and/or Canary deployment.

NEW QUESTION 29
Your company wants to understand where cost is coming from in the company's production AWS account. There are a number of applications and services
running at any given time. Without expending too much initial development time, how best can you give the business a good understanding of which applications
cost the most per month to operate?
A. Create an automation script which periodically creates AWS Support tickets requesting detailed intra-month information about your bill.
B. Use custom CIoudWatch Metrics in your system, and put a metric data point whenever cost is incurred.
C. Use AWS Cost Allocation Tagging for all resources which support i
D. Use the Cost Explorer to analyze costs throughout the month.
E. Use the AWS Price API and constantly running resource inventory scripts to calculate total price based on multiplication of consumed resources over time.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Cost Allocation Tagging is a built-in feature of AWS, and when coupled with the Cost Explorer, provides a simple and robust way to track expenses.
You can also use tags to filter views in Cost Explorer. Note that before you can filter views by tags in Cost Explorer, you must have applied tags to your resources
and activate them, as described in the following sections. For more information about Cost Explorer, see Analyzing Your Costs with Cost Explorer. Reference:

NEW QUESTION 33
Which of the following tools does not directly support AWS OpsWorks, for monitoring your stacks?
A. AWS Config
B. Amazon CIoudWatch Nletrics
C. AWS CloudTraiI
D. Amazon CIoudWatch Logs
Answer: A
Explanation:
You can monitor your stacks in the following ways: AWS OpsWorks uses Amazon CIoudWatch to provide thirteen custom metrics with detailed monitoring for each
instance in the stack; AWS OpsWorks integrates with AWS CIoudTraiI to log every AWS OpsWorks API call and store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket; You can
use Amazon CIoudWatch Logs to monitor your stack's system, application, and custom logs. Reference:

NEW QUESTION 37
What is a circular dependency in AWS CIoudFormation?
A. When a Template references an earlier version of itself.
B. When Nested Stacks depend on each other.
C. When Resources form a DependOn loop.
D. When a Template references a region, which references the original Templat
Answer: C
Explanation:
To resolve a dependency error, add a DependsOn attribute to resources that depend on other resources in your template. In some cases, you must explicitly
declare dependencies so that AWS CIoudFormation can create or delete resources in the correct order. For example, if you create an Elastic IP and a VPC
with an Internet gateway in the same stack, the Elastic IP must depend on the Internet gateway attachment. For additional information, see DependsOn Attribute.

NEW QUESTION 38
What is true of the way that encryption works with EBS?
A. Snapshotting an encrypted volume makes an encrypted snapshot; restoring an encrypted snapshot creates an encrypted volume when specified / requested.
B. Snapshotting an encrypted volume makes an encrypted snapshot when specified / requested; restoring an encrypted snapshot creates an encrypted volume
when specified / requested.
C. Snapshotting an encrypted volume makes an encrypted snapshot; restoring an encrypted snapshot always creates an encrypted volume.
D. Snapshotting an encrypted volume makes an encrypted snapshot when specified / requested; restoring an encrypted snapshot always creates an encrypted
volume.
Answer: C
Explanation:
Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted. Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically
encrypted. Your encrypted volumes and any associated snapshots always remain protected. For more information, see Amazon EBS Encryption.

When thinking of AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which statement is true?
A. Worker tiers pull jobs from SNS.
B. Worker tiers pull jobs from HTTP.
C. Worker tiers pull jobs from JSON.
D. Worker tiers pull jobs from SQ
Answer: D

NEW QUESTION 48
Your company needs to automate 3 layers of a large cloud deployment. You want to be able to track this depIoyment's evolution as it changes over time, and
carefully control any alterations. What is a good way to automate a stack to meet these requirements?
A. Use OpsWorks Stacks with three layers to model the layering in your stack.
B. Use CloudFormation Nested Stack Templates, with three child stacks to represent the three logicallayers of your cloud.
C. Use AWS Config to declare a configuration set that AWS should roll out to your cloud.
D. Use Elastic Beanstalk Linked Applications, passing the important DNS entires between layers using the metadata interface.
Answer: B

NEW QUESTION 52
Your appIication's Auto Scaling Group scales up too quickly, too much, and stays scaled when traffic decreases. What should you do to fix this?
A. Set a longer cooldown period on the Group, so the system stops overshooting the target capacit
B. The issue is that the scaling system doesn't allow enough time for new instances to begin servicing requests before measuring aggregate load again.
C. Calculate the bottleneck or constraint on the compute layer, then select that as the new metric, and set the metric thresholds to the bounding values that begin
to affect response latency.
D. Raise the CIoudWatch Alarms threshold associated with your autoscaling group, so the scaling takes more of an increase in demand before beginning.
E. Use larger instances instead of lots of smaller ones, so the Group stops scaling out so much and wasting resources as the OS level, since the OS uses a higher
proportion of resources on smaller instances.
Answer: B
Explanation:
Systems will always over-scale unless you choose the metric that runs out first and becomes constrained first. You also need to set the thresholds of the metric
based on whether or not latency is affected by the change, tojustify adding capacity instead of wasting money.
