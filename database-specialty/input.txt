Answer: C
Explanation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/concurrency-scaling.html
"With the Concurrency Scaling feature, you can support virtually unlimited concurrent users and concurrent queries, with consistently fast query performance.
When concurrency scaling is enabled, Amazon Redshift automatically adds additional cluster capacity when you need it to process an increase in concurrent read
queries. Write operations continue as normal on your main cluster. Users always see the most current data, whether the queries run on the main cluster or on a
concurrency scaling cluster. You're charged for concurrency scaling clusters only for the time they're in use. For more information about pricing, see Amazon
Redshift pricing. You manage which queries are sent to the concurrency scaling cluster by configuring WLM queues. When you enable concurrency scaling for a
queue, eligible queries are sent to the concurrency scaling cluster instead of waiting in line."

With Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility), you can audit events that were performed in your cluster. Examples of logged events include successful
and failed authentication attempts, dropping a collection in a database, or creating an index. By default, auditing is disabled on Amazon DocumentDB and requires
that you opt in to use this feature.
When auditing is enabled, Amazon DocumentDB records Data Definition Language (DDL), authentication, authorization, and user management events to Amazon
CloudWatch Logs. When auditing is enabled, Amazon DocumentDB exports your cluster’s auditing records (JSON documents) to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. You
can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to analyze, monitor, and archive your Amazon DocumentDB auditing events.

A. Use an Amazon RDS DB instanc
B. Shut down the instance once the data has been read.
C. Use Amazon Aurora Serverles
D. Allow the service to spin resources up and down, as needed.
E. Use Amazon DynamoDB in on-demand capacity mode.
F. Use Amazon S3 and load the data from flat files.
Answer: D
Explanation:
https://www.sumologic.com/insight/s3-cost-optimization/
For example, for 1 GB file stored on S3 with 1 TB of storage provisioned, you are billed for 1 GB only. In a lot of other services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon
Elastic Block Storage (Amazon EBS) and Amazon DynamoDB you pay for provisioned capacity. For example, in the case of Amazon EBS disk you pay for the size
of 1 TB of disk even if you just save 1 GB file. This makes managing S3 cost easier than many other services including Amazon EBS and Amazon EC2. On S3
there is no risk of over-provisioning and no need to manage disk utilization.

NEW QUESTION 43
A company has a heterogeneous six-node production Amazon Aurora DB cluster that handles online transaction processing (OLTP) for the core business and
OLAP reports for the human resources department. To match compute resources to the use case, the company has decided to have the reporting workload for the
human resources department be directed to two small nodes in the Aurora DB cluster, while every other workload goes to four large nodes in the same DB cluster.
Which option would ensure that the correct nodes are always available for the appropriate workload while meeting these requirements?
A. Use the writer endpoint for OLTP and the reader endpoint for the OLAP reporting workload.
B. Use automatic scaling for the Aurora Replica to have the appropriate number of replicas for the desired workload.
C. Create additional readers to cater to the different scenarios.
D. Use custom endpoints to satisfy the different workloads.
Answer: D
Explanation:
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/amazon-aurora-simplifies-workload-management-with-c You can now create custom endpoints for
Amazon Aurora databases. This allows you to distribute and load balance workloads across different sets of database instances in your Aurora cluster. For
example, you may provision a set of Aurora Replicas to use an instance type with higher memory capacity in order to run an analytics workload. A custom endpoint
can then help you route the analytics workload to these
appropriately-configured instances, while keeping other instances in your cluster isolated from this workload. As you add or remove instances from the custom
endpoint to match your workload, the endpoint helps spread the load around.

How should the Database Specialist satisfy this new requirement?
A. Create a snapshot of the unencrypted RDS DB instanc
B. Create an encrypted copy of the unencrypted snapsho
C. Restore the encrypted snapshot copy.
D. Modify the RDS DB instanc
E. Enable the AWS KMS encryption option that leverages the AWS CLI.
F. Restore an unencrypted snapshot into a MySQL RDS DB instance that is encrypted.
G. Create an encrypted read replica of the RDS DB instanc
H. Promote it the master.
Answer: A
Explanation:
"However, because you can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted DB snapshot, you can effectively add encryption to an unencrypted DB instance. That is, you can
create a snapshot of your DB instance, and then create an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the encrypted snapshot, and
thus you have an encrypted copy of your original DB instance. For more information, see Copying a Snapshot."

NEW QUESTION 103
A large ecommerce company uses Amazon DynamoDB to handle the transactions on its web portal. Traffic patterns throughout the year are usually stable;
however, a large event is planned. The company knows that traffic will increase by up to 10 times the normal load over the 3-day event. When sale prices are
published during the event, traffic will spike rapidly.
How should a Database Specialist ensure DynamoDB can handle the increased traffic?
A. Ensure the table is always provisioned to meet peak needs
B. Allow burst capacity to handle the additional load
C. Set an AWS Application Auto Scaling policy for the table to handle the increase in traffic
D. Preprovision additional capacity for the known peaks and then reduce the capacity after the event
Answer: D
Explanation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-partition-key-design.html#bp-partition "DynamoDB provides some flexibility in your perpartition throughput provisioning by providing burst
capacity. Whenever you're not fully using a partition's throughput, DynamoDB reserves a portion of that unused capacity for later bursts of throughput to handle
usage spikes. DynamoDB currently retains up to 5 minutes (300 seconds) of unused read and write capacity. During an occasional burst of read or write activity,
these extra capacity units can be consumed quickly—even faster than the per-second provisioned throughput capacity that you've defined for your table.
DynamoDB can also consume burst capacity for background maintenance and other tasks without prior notice. Note that these burst capacity details might change
in the future."

NEW QUESTION 180
Amazon Neptune is being used by a corporation as the graph database for one of its products. During an ETL procedure, the company's data science team
produced enormous volumes of temporary data by unintentionally. The Neptune DB cluster extended its storage capacity automatically to handle the added data,
but the data science team erased the superfluous data.
What should a database professional do to prevent incurring extra expenditures for cluster volume space that is not being used?
A. Take a snapshot of the cluster volum
B. Restore the snapshot in another cluster with a smaller volume size.
C. Use the AWS CLI to turn on automatic resizing of the cluster volume.
D. Export the cluster data into a new Neptune DB cluster.
E. Add a Neptune read replica to the cluste
F. Promote this replica as a new primary DB instanc
G. Reset the storage space of the cluster.
Answer: C
Explanation:
The only way to shrink the storage space used by your DB cluster when you have a large amount of unused allocated space is to export all the data in your graph
and then reload it into a new DB cluster. Creating and restoring a snapshot does not reduce the amount of storage allocated for your DB cluster, because a
snapshot retains the original image of the cluster's underlying storage.
