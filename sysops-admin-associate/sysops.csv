A company uses an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system to share files across many Linux Amazon EC2 instances. A SysOps administrator
notices that the file system's PercentIOLimit metric is consistently at 100% for 15 minutes or longer. The SysOps administrator also notices that the application that
reads and writes to that file system is performing poorly. They application requires high throughput and IOPS while accessing the file system.
What should the SysOps administrator do to remediate the consistently high PercentIOLimit metric?
A. Create a new EFS file system that uses Max I/O performance mod
B. Use AWS DataSync to migrate data to the new EFS file system.
C. Create an EFS lifecycle policy to transition future files to the Infrequent Access (IA) storage class to improve performanc
D. Use AWS DataSync to migrate existing data to IA storage.
E. Modify the existing EFS file system and activate Max I/O performance mode.
F. Modify the existing EFS file system and activate Provisioned Throughput mode.

Explanation:
To support a wide variety of cloud storage workloads, Amazon EFS offers two performance modes, General Purpose mode and Max I/O mode. You choose a file
system's performance mode when you create it, and it cannot be changed. If the PercentIOLimit percentage returned was at or near 100 percent for a significant

A company is running a serverless application on AWS Lambda The application stores data in an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance Usage has steadily
increased and recently there have been numerous "too many connections" errors when the Lambda function attempts to connect to the database The company
already has configured the database to use the maximum max_connections value that is possible
What should a SysOps administrator do to resolve these errors'?
A. Create a read replica of the database Use Amazon Route 53 to create a weighted DNS record that contains both databases
B. Use Amazon RDS Proxy to create a proxy Update the connection string in the Lambda function
C. Increase the value in the max_connect_errors parameter in the parameter group that the database uses
D. Update the Lambda function's reserved concurrency to a higher value
Answer: B
Explanation:
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-amazon-rds-proxy-with-aws-lambda/
RDS Proxy acts as an intermediary between your application and an RDS database. RDS Proxy establishes and manages the necessary connection pools to your
database so that your application creates fewer database connections. Your Lambda functions interact with RDS Proxy instead of your database instance. It
handles the connection pooling necessary for scaling many simultaneous connections created by concurrent Lambda functions. This allows your Lambda
applications to reuse existing connections, rather than creating new connections for every function invocation.
Check "Database proxy for Amazon RDS" section in the link to see how RDS proxy help Lambda handle huge connections to RDS MySQL
